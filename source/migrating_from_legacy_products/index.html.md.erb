# Migrate to GOV.UK Frontend from our old frameworks

You should migrate to GOV.UK Frontend if you're using one of the following old ('legacy') frameworks:

- GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit
- GOV.UK Template
- GOV.UK Elements

We're no longer updating our old frameworks, and they do not meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) accessibility standard](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

After you include GOV.UK Frontend in your project, your service should look and behave the same as before. This means you can migrate one component at a time in your live service.

Your service may be slightly slower while you migrate, because your users will need to download more CSS and JavaScript.

## Audit your service's components

To help you migrate, you should work with a designer to make a list of the components in your service, and compare it to [the components in GOV.UK Frontend](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/).

You can use your list to see where you can replace similar elements in your service with one GOV.UK Frontend component. For example, if you have a range of similar buttons, you may be able to replace them all with the [button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/) component.

We recommend using a template engine like [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to abstract each component into a reusable macro (also called a 'partial' or 'template'). You can do this before or during your migration.

If you use macros, your project will be easier to:

- migrate, because your project will be organised the same way we organise the GOV.UK Design System
- update when new versions of GOV.UK Frontend are released

If you're using Node.js, you can use [our Nunjucks macros](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/#nunjucks). You'll need to [install Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/getting-started.html) first.

## Include GOV.UK Frontend in your project

1. [Install GOV.UK Frontend using node package manager (npm)](/installing_with_npm).

    Do not install from `dist`, or you will not be able to turn on 'compatibility mode'.

2. [Turn on 'compatibility mode'](/compatibility_mode/#turn-on-39-compatibility-mode-39) so GOV.UK Frontend uses the colours and font from our old frameworks.

3. Test your application to make sure it looks the same and behaves correctly.

## Migrate your pages and components

After you install GOV.UK Frontend, you can either migrate:

- one page at a time - if your service is small, for example a single service with 10 pages
- one component at a time - if your service is big or complicated

### Migrate one page at a time

We recommend creating a separate page layout based on our [page template](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/), so that you can make changes without affecting the pages you haven't migrated yet.

You must:

- use GOV.UK Frontend markup for all the [typography](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/) and [layout](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/) in your service
- include and initialise GOV.UK Frontend's JavaScript for all the components that use it

Read about [how GOV.UK Pay migrated their service one page at a time](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2018/12/21/the-benefits-of-migrating-gov-uk-pays-codebase-to-the-gov-uk-design-system/).

### Migrate one component at a time

We recommend migrating in the following order:

- [components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/)
- [typography](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/)
- [header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)
- [footer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/)
- [page template](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/)

You must:

- use the GOV.UK Frontend markup for all the typography and layout in your service
- include and initialise GOV.UK Frontend's JavaScript for all the components that use it

To keep your design looking the same, you may need to add styles that [temporarily override GOV.UK Frontend styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#spacing-override-classes). For example, most GOV.UK Frontend components only have a bottom margin, so you may need to add temporary margins to the top, left or right.

## Update your custom code

If you've created custom code that uses variables, functions or mixins from GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit or GOV.UK Elements, you'll need to:

- use [GOV.UK Frontend variables, functions and mixins](/migrating_from_legacy_products/update_old_variables_classes_and_mixins/#replace-old-variables-classes-and-mixins-3) instead
- update your components' focus states so they're consistent with the [Design System's focus styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/focus-states/).

## Remove our old frameworks

Once you've completely migrated your service to GOV.UK Frontend, you can remove our old frameworks.

### 1. Uninstall

Uninstall GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit, GOV.UK Element and GOV.UK Template.

### 2. Turn off compatibility mode

[Turn off 'compatibility mode'](/compatibility_mode/#turn-off-39-compatibility-mode-39).

Replace the following old colour variables if you're using Sass.

Old colour|Suggested replacement
| --- | --- |
`bright-red`|`red`
`grey-1`|`dark-grey`
`grey-2`|`mid-grey`
`grey-3`|`light-grey`
`grey-4`|`light-grey`

You should also remove any temporary overrides you added when you migrated your components.

### 3. Test

You should check your application looks the same and works correctly, and that it's using:

- the [GOV.UK colour palette](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/)
- the [GOV.UK font](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#font)
- `rem` for font sizes

You should also use the developer tools in your browser to check that your project:

- is no longer using files from our old frameworks
- is downloading only one version of the font
- does not contain any unused stylesheets or JavaScript
