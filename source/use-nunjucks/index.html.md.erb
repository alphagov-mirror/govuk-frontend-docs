# Use Nunjucks

You can use our Nunjucks code to generate the HTML for pages and components.

You can also change the HTML that's generated by passing options into the Nunjucks code.

If you use Nunjucks, your project will be easier to update when a new version of GOV.UK Frontend is released.

To use Nunjucks:

- you must [install GOV.UK Frontend with Node.js package manager (npm)](/installing-with-npm/)
- your application and any frameworks that support it must use Node.js

You do not need to follow this guidance to [use Nunjucks macros in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/prototyping/#using-nunjucks-macros).

## Set up Nunjucks and use the page template

How you set up Nunjucks will depend on your environment. You can do the following to set up Nunjucks if you're using [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

1. Make sure Nunjucks is installed. For example, you can install Nunjucks while you're [installing GOV.UK Frontend with npm](/installing-with-npm).

2. Import the Nunjucks package, for example at the top of your main application file:

    ```javascript
    const nunjucks = require('nunjucks')
    ```

3. Tell Nunjucks where to find the GOV.UK Frontend template and components, by adding the following to your main application file:

    ```javascript
    nunjucks.configure([
      "node_modules/govuk-frontend/"
    ])
    ```

4. Use the GOV.UK Frontend template by adding the following at the top of your view file:

    ```javascript
    {% extends "govuk/template.njk" %}
    ```

5. Go to the [default page template example](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/#default) on the GOV.UK Design System website, then copy the Nunjucks code into your view file.

Find out how to [change how the page template works](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/#changing-template-content).

## Adding a component

You can go to any component page on the Design System website, then copy the Nunjucks macro code from the **Nunjucks** tab of any example.

For example, to add the breadcrumbs component to your page, copy the code from the **Nunjucks** tab in the first example on the [breadcrumbs component page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/breadcrumbs/).

## Changing a component

You can use options to change how a component looks or behaves.

For example, use the `text` option to change the text on a [button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/):

```javascript
{{ govukButton({
    text: "Example button text"
}) }}
```

To see the options for a component, select the **Nunjucks** tab of the component example on any Design System website page, then select **Nunjucks macro options**.

You must sanitise any HTML you pass in to Nunjucks macros youâ€™re using in your live application, to protect your website against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You can read more about [XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks#Cross-site_scripting_XSS) on the MDN website.
